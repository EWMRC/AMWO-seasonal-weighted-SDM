09:00:28	 From  Justin Vreeland : my alma mater!
09:21:56	 From  Steve Bernardi : can you overlay high migratory stop over areas and SGLs
09:22:40	 From  Samara (she/her) : I have a question about SGL size and suitability in the model.
09:24:25	 From  Liam Berigan (he/him) : woodcock.shinyapps.io/W-PAST/
09:25:24	 From  Justin Vreeland : any plans to explicitly incorporate DCNR lands - important cross-boundary collaboration
09:28:43	 From  Justin Vreeland : and large (i.e., forest game) hunter access properties
09:29:57	 From  Justin Vreeland : whats the pixel size?
09:32:32	 From  cunoll : Where is the best place to find info about ideal breeding vs. migratory habitat?
09:35:06	 From  Philip Kasper : Chapter 15 in the Wildlife Habitat Manual
09:35:17	 From  Justin Vreeland : were the data for the "hotspot" density distribution map you showed earlier from locations from the transmittered birds or some other source(s)
09:37:05	 From  Justin Vreeland : Dr. Roth: can you share any web links to the information you just mentioned?
09:37:21	 From  Amber Roth (she/her) : https://timberdoodle.org/appalachian
09:37:44	 From  Amber Roth (she/her) : And https://youngforest.org/
09:38:43	 From  Amber Roth (she/her) : Some PA projects are highlighted here https://youngforest.org/habitat-projects/mid-atlantic
09:40:26	 From  Justin Vreeland : dumb questions about woodcock biology: do they display different habitat selection between spring and fall migration?
09:42:19	 From  Justin Vreeland : üëç
09:44:47	 From  Samara (she/her) : Can the link(s) be put on the Habitat page on the intranet?
